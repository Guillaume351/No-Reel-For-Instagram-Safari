# No Reel for Instagram Privacy Statement

_Last updated: 2025-09-16_

## Overview
No Reel for Instagram is designed to keep your Instagram experience calm and distraction-free without collecting personal data. There are no subscriptions, accounts, or hidden data brokers involved. The app and Safari extension simply apply the filters you choose and keep them synchronized across your Apple devices via iCloud if you are signed in.

## Data We Do Not Collect
- No browsing history from Instagram or any other website
- No login credentials, social graphs, or personal content
- No usage analytics, crash reporters, or advertising identifiers

Your Instagram session remains between you and Instagram. We never transmit extension activity to our servers because we do not operate any.

## Settings and Sync
Selected filters (Hide Reels, Hide Stories, Hide "For You", Hide Suggested Users) are stored locally on your device. If you enable iCloud for the host app, these preferences synchronize privately through Apple's encrypted infrastructure so that your iOS and macOS apps stay in sync. You can reset the preferences at any time from the app's settings screen.

## Safari Extension Behavior
The Safari extension modifies the Instagram web interface in your browser tab based on your toggle selections. It does not intercept, log, or forward network traffic. All code runs locally within Safari's extension sandbox.

## macOS and iOS Host Apps
The companion apps provide a simple dashboard for managing the Safari extension. They do not require an account and never collect personal identifiers. The apps access iCloud Key-Value storage only for the purpose of keeping your toggle selections consistent across devices.

## Third-Party Services
We do not rely on third-party analytics, crash reporting, advertising networks, or payment processors. The only external services involved are Apple's App Store for distribution and iCloud for optional synchronization managed by Apple.

## Security Measures
- Follows Apple's sandboxing requirements for Safari extensions and App Store apps
- Uses iCloud's built-in encryption when synchronization is enabled
- Stores settings in the app group container isolated from other apps

## Your Choices
You can disable iCloud sync from the Apple system settings if you prefer to keep settings strictly on-device. Removing the app or extension deletes all stored preferences automatically. Reinstalling the app starts with the defaults, with no historical data retained.

## Updates to This Statement
If privacy practices change, we will update this page and include the new effective date. We recommend reviewing it when installing a new version of the app. Material changes will also appear in the app's release notes.
